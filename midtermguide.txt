A functional requirement describes what a software system should do, while non-functional requirements place constraints on how the system will do so.

An example of a functional requirement would be:

A system must send an email whenever a certain condition is met (e.g. an order is placed, a customer signs up, etc).

A related non-functional requirement for the system may be:

Emails should be sent with a latency of no greater than 12 hours from such an activity.
